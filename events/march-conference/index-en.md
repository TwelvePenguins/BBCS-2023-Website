# March Conference

The March Conference aims to foster an interest in programming by featuring three beginner-level workshops on Python, Data Analytics, and HTML, CSS and Javascript. To put your learning to the test, try out "Starvation", our very own open-source hackathon that sums up the conference!

## Key details
- Dates: 12th - 13th March for workshops, 16th March for Starvation competition
- Venue: Online
- Email contact for queries: <hello@buildingblocs.sg>

## Workshops

### _Introduction to Python_

This extensive workshop equips you with foundational Python skills such as basic data types, if statements, comparisons, loops and more!

### _Introduction to Data Analytics_

Pick up NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib skills and learn their basic operations and applications, essential for analysing trends and data with Python.

### _Introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript_

Wonder how websites are made? Experience the process yourself. Learn how to design a simple website from our experienced volunteers in this workshop!

## Starvation Competition

Capping off the March Conference will be a contest, but one that might catch some off guard. Unlike the classic Hackathon 
adopted in the June Conference, we will instead be organising our very own "Hackathon" for open-source
 ãƒ¼ Starvation. It's an open source gamified coding platform inspired by [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/), with the gameplay influenced by [BattleCats](https://battlecats.club/en/series/battlecats/). Solve coding challenges by applying your Python and data skills from the workshops for a beginner progression!
